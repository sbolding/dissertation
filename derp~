+sh to a maximum $\Delta t = 0.01$.
+In all simulations, 4 $\mu$ cells and 3 batches of 4,000 histories were used for the

+\section{The HO Spatial Closure}
+
+To investigate the utility of the face closures we compare to the LD spatial
+closure for two test problems.  We are interested in the accuracy of the solution and
+consistency between the HO and LO solutions, particularly for coarser meshes. 
+The consistency for the $(l)$-th particular simulation is measured with the relative L$_2$ norm
+of the difference between the projected HO and LO solutions, i.e.,
+\begin{equation}
+    \|\phi_{HO} - \phi_{LO}\|^{(l)}_{2,rel} = \frac{\ds \sqrt{\int_0^X \left(
+        \phi_{HO}^{n+1,(l)}(x) - \phi_{LO}^{n+1,(l)}(x) \right)^2 \dd x}}{\ds \sqrt{
+            \int_0^X \left(\phi_{LO}^{n+1,(l)}(x)\right)^2 \dd x }}
+\end{equation}
+where $\phi_{LO}(x)$ and $\phi_{HO}(x)$ are the LDFE representations in space of the
+intensity from the HO and LO solvers, from the end of the last time step.
+The error between a reference solution and a fine solution for the ${(l)}$-th simulation
+is computed as
+\begin{equation}
+    \|e\|^{{(l)}}_{2,rel} = \frac{\|\phi_{LO}^{n+1,{(l)}}(x) -
+    \phi_{LO}^{n+1,ref}\left( x \right)\|_2}{\|\phi_{LO}^{n+1,ref}\left( x \right)\|_2}
+\end{equation}
+All L$_2$ norms are computed using quadrature over the finest spatial mesh.  An
+integrated measure of the error in cell-averaged mean intensities on the mesh of the
+$l$-th simulation, with $N_c^{(l)}$ spatial cells, is computed as
+\begin{equation}
+    \|e\|^{{(l)}}_{a,rel} = \left({\frac{\ds \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N^{(l)}_c}
+    \left(\phi_i^{n+1,{(l)}} - \phi_i^{n+1,ref}
+\right)^2}{\ds \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N^{(l)}_c}\left(\phi_i^{n+1,ref}\right)^2}}\right)^{1/2},
+\end{equation}
+where $\phi_i^{n+1,ref}$ is computed by spatially averaging the fine mesh solution over
+the $i$-th coarse spatial cell.
+
+The sample mean of each of the above metrics is estimated based on 20 independent
+simulations; the sample standard deviation for each \emph{mean} is also reported, e.g.,
+\begin{equation}
+    s\left(\|e\|_{2,rel}\right) = \left[\frac{1}{20-1}\sum_{l=1}^{20} \left(
+    \|e\|_{2,rel}^{(l)} - \|e\|_{2,rel} \right)^2\right]^{1/2},
+\end{equation}
+where $\|e\|_{2,rel}=\sum_{l=1}^{20}\|e\|_{2,rel}^{(l)}/20$ is the mean.
+
+\subsection{Smooth Problem}
+
+For this problem, the radiation and material energies are initially in
+equilibrium at $0.01$ keV.   An isotropic incident intensity of 0.05 keV is applied
+at $x=0$; the incident intensity on the right boundary is $0.05$ keV.
+The material properties are $\rho = 1$ g cm$^{-3}$, $c_v = 0.2$ jks/keV-g, and
+$\sigma_a=10$ cm$^{-1}$.
+The simulation end time is 0.5 sh.  The time step size increases by 10\% each time step
+until the maximum step size of 0.01 sh is reached, beginning from $\Delta t = 0.001$ sh.
+This problem is intended to have less steep gradients in the intensity by having constant constant cross
+sections, a smaller boundary source, and diffusive problem parameters.
+The problem has a smaller optical thickness than other problems tested so that the face-based solutions can be efficiently
+estimated, but the small c$_v$ value makes the solution relatively diffusive.  This
+problem did not require the lumped relation to produce positive solutions.
+However, when projecting from a refined mesh back to the coarse mesh, it was
+necessary to rotate the solution to be positive.
+
+All simulations of this problem used 585,900 histories divided over 9 ECMC
+batches;  beginning from 30,000 histories and $10$ $\mu$ cells, 30\% of cells were
+adaptively refined every third batch, and the number of histories is increased to
+keep the average number of histories per cell constant. 
+We have have performed two outer HOLO iterations over each time step for all cases; it was
+found that additional iterations did not increase consistency, because of the  magnitude
+of statistical noise.  Relative convergence of HOLO iterations was below 10$^{-3}$
+for two iterations for all cases.  
+Fig.~\ref{fig:smooth_compare} compares cell-averaged radiation temperatures for various spatial closures at
+coarse mesh sizes and a fine-mesh solution.  The HO spatial closures curve is for the
+scaled-slope closure given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:cl_slope}.  There was visually
+no difference in the results between the scaled-averaged, scaled-slope, or LD closure. A step closure in all cells
+was inaccurate for this problem.
+
+Table~\ref{tab:smooth} compares the different error metrics for different spatial
+closures and numbers of cells.  The reference solution for all calculations was the average of 10 simulations with $N_c=500$ spatial
+cells.  In all cases, the HO spatial closure produces higher accuracy in the L$_2$
+norms and greater consistency between the solvers.  However, there is not an
+improvement in accuracy of the cell-averaged intensities.  Neglecting noise, the LDFE representation can be third order
+accurate for the $\|e\|_a$ norm and second-order accurate in the L$_2$ norm~\cite{morel_ldtrt}. 
+The statistical noise induced in face tallies makes the
+additional accuracy that the MC transport can use not greater than the benefit of
+higher spatial integration by the MC transport.  It
+is noted that, overall, there is very low statistical noise in each of these
+solutions due to the ECMC method and relatively high number of histories; at lower
+history counts, the small gains of the HO spatial closure will degrade and stability
+becomes an issue.

+\subsection{Two Material Problem}
+
+The HO spatial closures were applied to solution of the two material problem detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:two}.
+For these results, a small time step size of 0.001 sh was used, with a simulation end time
+of 2 sh.  The scaled-slope closure was found to not stably converge, even for 2 batches of 10$^6$
+histories.  The scale-average closure allowed for convergence, with the lumpded closure, but temperatures were driven
+below the floor, and at times negative, leading to inaccurate solution.  The inaccuracies
+result from the outflow being driving negative in cells near the wave front with steep
+gradients.  The cause is that, although the HO solution was forced positive by scaling
+moments, and the face solution is positive the closure does not necessarily agree with the

 \section{Preservation of the Discrete Maximum Principle}
 
-An important property for a discretization of the TRT equations is preservation of the
-discrete maximum principle (MP).  The maximum principle states that the material temperature and mean intensity in the
-interior of the domain should be bounded by the solution at the boundaries of the domain, in the
-absence of interior energy sources~\cite{wollaber2013discrete,larsen_mpv}.  The analytic solution to the TRT equations satisfies a maximum
-principle~\cite{larsen_mpv}, so we desire numerical approximations that preserve the MP in
-a discrete sense, for each time step.
-%For the discrete MP, we expect the numerical solution to be bounded by the boundary
-%conditions at each time step.
-For IMC simulations, violation of the maximum principle results in the material
-temperature being artificially higher than the radiation temperature.  As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, IMC can violate the MP due to
-the approximate linearization of the emission source in the time discretization; it is not
-truly implicit in time.  We expect our method, with a fully implicit time discretization,
-to preserve the MP with sufficient convergence of the nonlinear emission
-source~\cite{larsen_mpv}.
-
-To numerically demonstrate that our method preserves the MP, we have simulated problems
-similar to those in~\cite{wollaber2013discrete}.  We modify the Marshak wave problem in
-Sec.~\ref{sec:marshak???}, by decreasing $c_v$ and increasing $\sigma_a$, to produce a
-problem which results in MP violations for IMC at various fixed time step sizes. 
-The spatial and temporal discretization determine the occurence of MP violations for
+To numerically demonstrate that our method preserves the discrete MP, as discussed in
+Sec.~\ref{sec:imc},  we have simulated problems similar to those
+in~\cite{wollaber2013discrete}.  We produce a problem with tightly coupled
+equations, by decreasing $c_v$ and increasing $\sigma_a$, which results in MP violations for IMC at various fixed time step sizes. 
+The spatial and temporal discretization determine the occurrence of MP violations for
 IMC. In particular, if time steps are too large or spatial
 mesh cells are too small, IMC will demonstrate MP violations~\cite{wollaber2013discrete}.  Here, we have kept the
 spatial mesh size fixed and increased the time step size to produce MP violations.
-The material
-specifications for the problem are given in Table~\ref{tab:mpv_prob}. The domain width is 2.0 cm with
+The material specifications are  $\sigma_{a} = \sigma_{a,0} T^{-3}$ cm$^{-1}$,
+$\sigma_{a,0} = 4$ cm$^{-1}$ keV$^3$, $\sigma_s=0$ cm$^{-1}$, $\rho c_v = 0.0081181$
+jks keV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$.  The domain width is 2.0 cm with
 $N_c=150$ uniform spatial mesh cells.  The radiation and material energies are initially in
 equilibrium at $0.01$ keV, before an isotropic boundary source of $1$ keV is applied at
 the left boundary at $t=0$. The simulation end time is $t=0.1$ sh. 
 
 The material and radiation temperature are plotted for an IMC simulation with $\Delta
-t=0.025$ sh in
-Figure~\ref{fig:imc_mpvrad}.  Figure~\ref{fig:imc_mpv} depicts the material temperature

 for various time step sizes and the fixed mesh size of 150 cells. All IMC
 simulations used 100,000 histories per time step. As demonstrated in
 Fig.~\ref{fig:imc_mpvrad}, the material temperature exceeds the specified boundary
 temperature and is artificially hotter than the radiation temperature.  This artificial
 ``temperature spike'' also leads to a slower propagation of the
 wave~\cite{wollaber2013discrete}.  As shown in
-Fig.~\ref{fig:imc_mpv}, as larger time-step sizes are taken the nonphysical results worsen.

 It is noted that although the final solution for $\Delta t=0.0001$ sh obeys the MP, during
 the first few time steps the temperature spikes are present.

 The simulations are repeated with the same specifications for the HOLO method. All HOLO
 simulations used a fixed mesh of 8 $\mu$ cells by 150 $x$ cells, 3 batches per time step,
 and 6,000 histories per batch. A single HO solve is performed per time step, and the LO
-relative convergence tolerance is $10^{-6}$. The lumping closure is used in all spatial
-cells and any negativities in the HO solution are rotated to the floor value.

 As seen in
 Fig.~\ref{fig:holo_mpv}, the HOLO solution does not violate the maximum principle; the
 temperature is bounded from above by the radiation boundary condition.
