\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.

Starting with the obvious, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Jim Morel for your guidance and 
willingness to empart your transport wisdom to me.  In addition to being a prime source of
knowledge, as an advisor, you seem to find the appropriate balance between blind patience and hard-nosed
motivation, where the focus is always exclusively on the problem being solved. 
 I would also like to thank Dr. McClarren and Dr. Ragusa for always willingly providing
alternative view points and discussion on interesting topics, often unrelated to work and
occasionally involving fine beverages. Overall, it has been a pleasure being part of this research group. 

 I would also like to thank my parents for a great childhood and continuing to support me, as well
as never pressuring me to get a real job or take over the farm\ldots yet.  And of course my friends
at A\&M deserve some credit, for the constant antics and shenanigans that take the edge off of grad
school.  And finally, I would like to thank my (now) wife Madeline.  I think it goes without much
explanation, but you have always made my life pleasant and enjoyable.
