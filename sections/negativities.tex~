\label{chp:negativities}

The linear-discontinuous (LD) spatial closure with upwinding is not strictly positive.  In
particular, for optically thick cells with a steep intensity gradient, the linear
representation of the intensity can become negative at the edge of the cells.  A common
example in 1D is for the Marshak Wave problem where negative intensities in the
representation occurs at the foot of the radiation wave front. These negativities are not
physical and typically propagate to adjacent cells through the streaming term. In thick regions of TRT problems,
reasonably fine spatial cells can still be on the order of millions of mean free paths;
negativities with an LD representation are unavoidable in practice for such cells, and
mesh refinement is of minimal use.  The LDFE representation of the intensity for the HO solver is prone to additional negativities near
$\mu=0$ where the intensity often cannot be accurately represented by a linear projection in
angle.  These negativities near $\mu=0$ can occur for modest optical thicknesses and in
multiple adjacent cells, caused in part by the previous intensity source term which has a
strong gradient in $\mu$. 

In the remainder of this chapter, we present different fixup methods applied to the HO solver.
Methods are then compared for statistical efficiency and accuracy for test problems.
Ideally the fixup should be applied in a manner that the solutions in such cells are as consistent as possible between the HO
and LO equations.  However, even if the HO fixup was applied consistently to the LO
next nonlinear LO solve, this would be based on a lagged HO problem so there is no
guarantee of positivity for the new LO solution. Additionally, the LO solver must preserve
energy conservation, whereas the HO solver is primarily used for angular shape parameters
and is not conservative. Thus, because of the difference in solution
methods of the two system, independent fixups have been developed.  

\section{Calculating a Positive LDFE Representation}
\label{sec:pos_ldfe}

For the HO solver, in cells near the radiation wavefront, the LDFE trial space results in
negative values in $\tilde{I}^{n+1}(x,\mu)$, similar to the LO solver.  In general, in
such cells where the trial space cannot accurately represent the solution, error
stagnation will rapidly occur.  At the end of any particular batch, a LDFE projection of
the intensity $\tilde I(x,\mu)$ has been determined.  This projection is based on a
statistical estimate of the moments of the intensity, based on the truncated
representation of sources.  Although the statistically estimated moments are physically
accurate, when these moments are projected onto a linear space the representation becomes
negative, over some portion of certain elements' domains.  Because the residual
formulation in ECMC allows for negative weight particles to occur, there is not a strict
requirement to fixup the cells.  However, in cells where $\tilde{I}^{n+1}(x,\mu)$ crosses
zero, the angular consistency terms are not guaranteed to lie in the appropriate
half-space, potentially introducing instabilities.  

The first moments can easily be modified, rotating the linear representation for the intensity
about the average, to produce a positive representation $\tilde
I_{\pos}$ at the end of a batch.  We produce a positive representation $\tilde
I_{\text{\pos}}$ over a cell by scaling the first moment in $x$ and $\mu$ uniformly.  The
process of modifying the first moments to produce a positive solution is under defined, so
there is not a unique way to enforce positivity.  This choice is not an emphasis of this
research, so we have applied the simple approach of scaling the slopes such that
the ratio $I_x/I_\mu$, for each modified cell, is unchanged.  After an ECMC batch, we
detect cells where the linear representation produces a value below the floor.    The
modified representation for the $ij$-th cell in such cells is
\begin{equation}
    \tilde I_{\pos} = I_{a} + C\left[\frac{2}{h_x}I_x(x-x_i) +
    \frac{2}{h_\mu}I_\mu(\mu-\mu_j)\right],\quad     (x,\mu) \in \mathcal{D}_{ij},
\end{equation}
noting that the average has not been modified.
The constant $C$ is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    C =  \frac{I_{a} - I_{\min}}{\lvert I_x \rvert + \lvert I_\mu \rvert}
\end{equation}
for values where $I_{a} > I_{\min}$, where $I_{\min}$ is the isotropic intensity
corresponding to equilibrium with the floor temperature.  When $I_a$ is below the floor, it is set to
the floor value and $I_x$ and $I_\mu$ set to zero.  It is been noted that in application
the difference between $I_{a}$ and $I_{\min}$ can be on the order of numerical roundoff for
double precision variables.

\section{Artificial Source Method for Negativities in the HO Intensity}

The moments of the modified positive solution $\tilde I_{\pos}$ will not necessarily
satisfy the residual equation as accurately as the original solution, which leads to rapid
error stagnation.  Additionally, the next MC batch based on the residual source from
$\tilde I_{\pos}$ can produce negative cell averages in down stream cells.  Thus, we have
devised a method to modify the transport equation such that $\tilde I_{\pos}$ will locally
satisfy the residual equation more accurately.  We do this in such a manner that the
modified source will lead to the solution converging towards a solution with the same
zeroth moment, but with a first moment in $x$ and $\mu$ that are modified.  This does not
guarantee exponential convergence of the solution, because convergence is still limited by
the overall accuracy of the trial space and statistics within a batch.  However, now the
error will not stagnate as rapidly and the solution will converge towards the positive
representation $\tilde I_{\pos}$.

To mitigate stagnation and improve efficiency, we can add an artificial source
$\tilde\delta^{m+1}(x,\mu)$ to the HO transport equation.
This source is estimated iteratively as
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde\delta(x,\mu)^{(m+1)} = \mathbf{L}(\tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)} -
    \tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)}_{\text{pos}}),
\end{equation*}
where $\tilde{I}_{\pos}^{n+1,(m)}$ is the modified positive solution, for all cells that required
modification.  The source $\tilde
\delta$ is added to all later batches.  If necessary, we can add an additional source in
later batches where negative values occur once more. The residual for the modified
transport problem will have the same residual magnitude as the original $\tilde I$, which
will have lower magnitude than the modified solution which does not have the MC estimated
first moments (this is only true for the first application of the modified source).  Care
must be taken to modify the source on the interior and exterior of the cell,
particularly when the solutions in adjacent cells has been modified.  The source
$\tilde\delta$ lies in the same functional space as the residual and can thus use the
existing code infrastructure to compute the source.  This will also make this approach
straight forward to extend to higher dimensions and adaptively refined meshes.  

To provide insight into the choice of this source, consider the modified transport problem
that will be solved with ECMC, where the fixup has been applied at batch $m$:
\begin{equation}
   \B L I^{n+1} = q + \mathbf{L}(\tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)} -
    \tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)}_{\text{pos}})
\end{equation}
Application of $\B L^{-1}$ to both sides of the equation produces
\begin{equation}
    I^{n+1} = \B L^{-1} q + (\tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)} -
    \tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)}_{\text{pos}}).
\end{equation}
Because $\tilde I$ and $\tilde I_\pos$ have the same zeroth moment, we have not modified
the zeroth moment of the solution overall, in the limit of an infinite number of histories.  Monte Carlo transport is used to estimate $L^{-1}$, thus 
we are estimating the solution to a transport problem that has a modified first moment in the LDFE projection but preserves the
zeroth moment of the original solution.  The estimate of the modification to the first
moments of the solution has statistical noise, and thus may under- or over-predict the
necessary change in the solution.  We make the conservative choice of preserving $\delta$
across batches, and adding an additional source only when negative values occur again. 

\section{Computational Results}

We will apply several different fixup approaches based on the above discussion.
The first method, labeled as ``S$_2$ fixup'' is the simplified fixup used to generate some
of the results in Chapter~\ref{chp:results}: we detect if
the consistency terms lie in the appropriate half space at the end of the HO solve,
an indication that the intensity was negative within that cell.  If the terms are non-physical, then
they are replaced with the corresponding S$_2$-equivalent value. At the end of each time
step the solution is rotated positive for the next time step.  The second method, labeled
as ``Rotate Every Batch'' rotates the solution above the floor value as needed at the end of every batch, as
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:pos_ldfe}.  The method ``Rotate Last Batch'' only applies the
fixup at the end of the final batch, allowing negative intensities in earlier batches.
The final approach is labeled ``Artificial Source'' and is described in the previous
section.  The artificial source is not saved
between time steps.

\subsection{Analytic Fixed Source Problem}

We first test the fixup methods for an analytic fixed-source, pure-absorber transport problem.  It is
difficult to generate an analytic answer to non-trivial TRT problems, so we apply the
fixups to a
fixed-source problem with similar characteristics to the two material problem in
Sec.~\ref{sec:two} that produces negative solutions for $\tilde I(x,\mu)$.  The general
isotropic source is proportional to $\sigma_a$, so the 1D transport equation to be solved is 
\begin{equation}\label{apptr}
    \mu \pderiv{I(x,\mu)}{x} + \sigma_a I(x,\mu) = \frac{q_0\sigma_a(x)}{2}.
\end{equation}
The form of the source simulates a floor equilibrium distribution and ensures that $\phi^-(x)$ is a
constant throughout the domain with appropriate boundary conditions. 

For this problem, the domain width is 1.0 cm and $\sigma_s=0$ throughout.  The absorption
cross section is defined as $\sigma_a=0.2$ cm$^{-1}$ for $0\leq x <0.5$ cm and $\sigma_a=1000$ cm$^{-1}$ for
$0.5<x\leq1.0$ cm.  The analytic solution
for the mean intensity, as derived in App.~\ref{sec:analytic_neutronics}, is
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x) = I_{inc}\E2\left[\tau(x)\right] + \frac{q_0}{2} \left(2 -
    \E2\left[\tau(x)\right]\right),
\end{equation}
where $I_{inc}=1000$ cm$^{-2}$ str$^{-1}$ is the incident intensity at the left
boundary and $q_0 = 0.5$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$; The equilibrium solution which is
used as the floor in the applied fixups is $I_{\min} = 0.5$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ str$^{-1}$.

The problem was simulated with the HOLO algorithm with four batches of 100,000 histories,
with no HO fixup.
For the LO solver, the lumped LD spatial closure is used in all cells.
For the single HO solve, the solution is initialized to $\tilde I(x,\mu)=q_0/2$.
A plot of the HO representation for the 
intensity\footnote{The triangular structure in the plots are only an artifact of the plotting
software.} is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:neut_ang_full} from the end of the HO solve.
Figure~\ref{fig:neut_ang_zoom} depicts the solution for all cells in which $\tilde
I(x,\mu)$ is
below $I_{\min}$, for some portion of that cell's domain, using a smaller scale for visual clarity.
As expected, near $\mu=0$ and near the interface of the thick material the LDFE projection
is driven negative and cannot accurately represent the solution.

The various fixup methods were tested on this problem for different numbers of simulated histories.  The L$_2$
norm of the error in cell-averaged mean intensities $\|e\|_{a,rel}$ was computed using
Eq.~\eqref{eq:avg_err} for both the HO and LO solutions, averaged over 100
simulations.  Table~\ref{tab:fixed_source_accuracy} compares the errors and FOM values. 
The absolute sample standard deviation follows each value in parenthesis 
as appropriate.  Generally, the artificial source fixup did not improve accuracy or
statistics for this problem, and the other fixups show similar performance.
%Fig.~\ref{???} compares the scalar intensities for the different methods.
In some cases
the artificial source led to additional negative values in down-stream space-angle cells in later
batches.  It is noted that for
this problem that although some negative intensities occur, for the S$_2$ fixup angular consistency terms
were non-physical in only a few cases.

\subsection{Radiative Transfer Problems}

We now test each of the fixups to the Marshak wave problem and two material problem from
Secs.~\ref{sec:marsh} and~\ref{sec:two}. For both problems, $\Delta t$ is
linearly increased from 0.001 sh to a maximum step size of $\Delta t_{\max} = 0.01$ sh,
the lumped representation is used for the LO solver in all cells, and the single HO solve
has three uniform batches of histories per time step.

For the two material problem, the simulation end time is 2 sh.
Table~\ref{tab:twomat_fixups} compares sample statistics for cell-averaged solutions from
the final time step for the two material problem and different numbers of histories per
time step.  The statistics were generated with 20 independent simulations, for each case.
For this problem, there is a slight improvement in statistics with the artificial source
approach.  A plot of the radiation temperature for the final LO solution is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:twomat_fix} for each of the fixups and a reference solution.  Each plotted
solution is for a single simulation with $120,000$
histories per time step. Visually
there is agreement between all of the fixup methods.

The process is repeated for the Marshak wave problem with a simulation end time of $t=5$ sh. 
Table~\ref{tab:marshak_fix} compares sample statistics, and Fig.~\ref{fig:marshak_fix}
compares LO radiation temperatures for the case of $100,000$ histories per time step.
For this problem, the artificial source method is less statistically efficient. 
Visually there is a slight dispersion in one cell for the artificial source method.  This
is caused by the artificial source method introducing extra slope into the solution.
The zeroth moment of the intensity can be affected for a finite number of histories.  In
this case, the extra volumetric source is being sampled and leading to artificial energy
propagation down stream.  Generally, although locally the stagnation of the residual is
being reduced by the added source, there is potential for down stream cells to be affected
by under-sampling, decreasing the overall efficiency and accuracy.
