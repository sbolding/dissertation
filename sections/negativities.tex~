\label{chp:negativities}

The linear-discontinuous (LD) spatial closure with upwinding is not strictly positive.  In
particular, for optically thick cells with a steep intensity gradient, the linear
representation of the intensity can become negative at the edge of the cells.  A common
example in 1D is for the Marshak Wave problem where negative intensities in the
representation occurs at the foot of the radiation wave front. These negativities are not
physical and typically propagate to adjacent cells through the streaming term. In thick regions of TRT problems,
reasonably fine spatial cells can still be on the order of millions of mean free paths;
negativities with an LD representation are unavoidable in practice for such cells, and
mesh refinement is of minimal use.  The LDFE representation of the intensity for the HO solver is prone to additional negativities near
$\mu=0$ where the intensity often cannot be accurately represented by a linear projection in
angle.  These negativities near $\mu=0$ can occur for modest optical thicknesses and in
multiple adjacent cells, caused in part by the previous intensity source term which has a
strong gradient in $\mu$. 

In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss fixup methods applied to the HO solver.
Methods are then compared for statistical efficiency and accuracy for test problems.
Ideally the fixup should be applied in a manner that the solutions in such cells are as consistent as possible between the HO
and LO equations.  However, modifications made to the HO solver would be lagged in the
next nonlinear LO solve, so there would be no guarantee of positivity if the fixup is
consistently applied to the next LO solve. Additionally, the LO solver must preserve
energy conservation, whereas the HO solver is primarily used for angular shape parameters
and is generally not conservative. Thus, because of the difference in solution
methods of the two system, independent fixups have been developed.  

\section{Calculating a Positive LDFE Representation}
\label{sec:pos_ldfe}

For the HO solver, in cells near the radiation wavefront, the LDFE trial space results in
negative values in $\tilde{I}^{n+1}(x,\mu)$, similar to the LO solver.  In general, in
such cells where the trial space cannot accurately represent the solution, error
stagnation will rapidly occur.  At the end of any particular batch, a LDFE projection of
the intensity $\tilde I(x,\mu)$ has been determined.  This projection is based on a
statistical estimate of the moments of the intensity, based on the truncated
representation of sources.  Although the statistically estimated moments are physically
accurate, when these moments are projected onto a linear space the representation becomes
negative, over some portion of certain elements' domains.  Because the residual
formulation in ECMC allows for negative weight particles to occur, there is not a strict
requirement to fixup the cells.  However, in cells where $\tilde{I}^{n+1}(x,\mu)$ crosses
zero, the angular consistency terms are not guaranteed to lie in the appropriate
half-space, potentially introducing instabilities.  

The first moments can easily be modified to produce a positive representation $\tilde
I_{\pos}$ at the end of a batch.  We produce a positive representation $\tilde
I_{\text{\pos}}$ over a cell by scaling the first moment in $x$ and $\mu$ uniformly.  The
process of modifying the first moments to produce a positive solution is under defined, so
there is not a unique way to enforce positivity.  This choice is not an emphasis of this
research, so we have applied the simple approach of scaling the slopes such that
the ratio $I_x/I_\mu$, for each modified cell, is unchanged.  After an ECMC batch, we
detect cells where the linear representation produces a value below the floor.    The
modified representation for the $ij$-th cell in such cells is
\begin{equation}
    \tilde I_{\pos} = I_{a} + C\left[\frac{2}{h_x}I_x(x-x_i) +
    \frac{2}{h_\mu}I_\mu(\mu-\mu_j)\right],\quad     (x,\mu) \in \mathcal{D}_{ij},
\end{equation}
noting that the average has not been modified.
The constant $C$ is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    C =  \frac{I_{a} - I_{\min}}{\lvert I_x \rvert + \lvert I_\mu \rvert}
\end{equation}
for values where $I_{a} > I_{\min}$, where $I_{\min}$ is the isotropic intensity
corresponding to equilibrium with the floor temperature.  When $I_a$ is below the floor, it is set to
the floor value and $I_x$ and $I_\mu$ set to zero.  It is been noted that in application
the difference between $I_{a}$ and $I_{\min}$ can be on the order of numerical roundoff for
double precision variables.

\section{Artificial Source Method for Negativities in the HO Intensity}

The moments of the modified positive solution $\tilde I_{\pos}$ will
not necessarily satisfy the residual equation as accurately as the original solution, which leads to
rapid error stagnation.  Additionally, the next MC batch based on the residual source from
$\tilde I_{\pos}$ can produce negative cell averages in down stream cells.
Thus, we have devised
a method to modify the transport equation such that $\tilde I_{\pos}$ will locally satisfy the
residual equation more accurately.  We do this in such a manner that the
modified source will lead to the solution converging towards a solution with the same
zeroth moment, but with a first moment in $x$ and $\mu$ that are modified.  This does not
guarantee exponential convergence of the solution, because convergence is still limited by
the overall accuracy of the trial space and statistics within a batch.  However, now the error will not stagnate as rapidly
and the solution will converge towards the positive representation $\tilde I_{\pos}$.

To mitigate stagnation and improve accuracy, we can add an artificial source
$\tilde\delta^{m+1}(x,\mu)$ to the HO transport equation.
This source is estimated iteratively as
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde\delta(x,\mu)^{(m+1)} = \mathbf{L}(\tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)} -
    \tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)}_{\text{pos}}),
\end{equation*}
where $\tilde{I}_{pos}^{n+1}$ is the modified positive solution. The source $\tilde
\delta$ is added to all later batches.  If necessary, we can add an additional source in later batches where negative values occur once more. The residual for the
modified transport problem will have the same residual magnitude as the original $\tilde
I$, which will have lower magnitude than the modified solution which does not have the MC
estimated first moments (this is only true for the first application of the modified
source).  Care must be
taken to modify the source on the interior and exterior of the solution, particularly when
the solutions in adjacent cells has been modified.  The source
$\tilde\delta$ lies in the same functional space as the residual and can thus use
the existing code infrastructure to compute the source.  This will also make this approach
straight forward to extend to higher dimensions.  

To provide insight into this choice of source, consider the modified transport problem
that will be solved with ECMC, where the fixup has been applied at batch $m$:
\begin{equation}
   \B L I^{n+1} = q + \mathbf{L}(\tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)} -
    \tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)}_{\text{pos}})
\end{equation}
Application of $\B L^{-1}$ to both sides of the equation produces
\begin{equation}
    I^{n+1} = \B L^{-1} q + (\tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)} -
    \tilde{I}^{n+1,(m)}_{\text{pos}}).
\end{equation}
Because $\tilde I$ and $\tilde I_\pos$ have the same zeroth moment, we have not modified
the zeroth moment of the solution overall.  Monte Carlo transport is used to estimate $L^{-1}$, thus 
we are estimating the solution to a transport problem that has a positive LDFE projection but preserves the
zeroth moment of the original solution.  The estimate of the modification to the first
moments of the solution has statistical noise, and thus may under- or over-predict the
necessary change in the solution.  We make the conservative choice of preserving $\delta$
across batches, and adding an additional source only when negative values occur again. 

\section{Computational Results}

We detect if
the consistency terms lie in the appropriate half space at the end of the HO solve,
an indication that the intensity was negative within that cell.  If the terms are non-physical, then
they are replaced with the corresponding S$_2$-equivalent value.

\subsection{Analytic Fixed Source Problem}

We first test the artificial source fixup for an analytic fixed-source, pure-absorber transport problem.  It is
difficult to generate an analytic answer to non-trivial TRT problems, so we apply the
fixups to a
fixed-source problem with similar characteristics to the two material problem in
Sec.~\ref{sec:two} that produces negative solutions for $\tilde I(x,\mu)$.  The general
isotropic source is proportional to $\sigma_a$, so the 1D transport equation to be solved is 
\begin{equation}\label{apptr}
    \mu \pderiv{I(x,\mu)}{x} + \sigma_a I(x,\mu) = \frac{q_0\sigma_a(x)}{2}.
\end{equation}
The form of the source simulates a floor equilibrium distribution and ensures that $\phi^-(x)$ is a
constant throughout the domain with appropriate boundary conditions. i

For this problem, the domain width is 1.0 cm and $\sigma_s=0$ throughout.  The cross
sections are $\sigma_a=0.2$ \invcm for $0\leq x <0.5$ cm and $\sigma_a=1000$ for
$0.5<x\leq1.0$ cm.  The analytic solution
for the mean intensity, as derived in App.~\ref{sec:analytic_neutronics}, is
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x) = I_{inc}\E2\left[\tau(x)\right] + \frac{q_0}{2} \left(2 -
    \E2\left[\tau(x)\right]\right),
\end{equation}
where $I_{inc}=1000$ cm$^{-2}$ str$^{-1}$ is the incident intensity at the left
boundary and $q_0 = 0.5$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$; The equilibrium solution which is
used as the floor in the applied fixups is $I_{\min} = 0.5$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ str$^{-1}$.

The problem was simulated with the HOLO algorithm with four batches of 100,000 histories.
For the LO solver, the lumped LD spatial closure is used in all cells.
For the single HO solve, the solution is initialized to $\tilde I(x,\mu)=q_0/2$.
A plot of the angular
intensity\footnote{The triangular structure in the plots are only an artifact of the plotting
software.} is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:neut_ang_full} from the end of the HO solve.
Figure~\ref{fig:neut_ang_zoom} depicts the solution for all cells in which the solution goes
below $I_{\min}$ for some portion of the domain, using a smaller scale for visual clarity.
As expected, near $\mu=0$ and near the interface of the thick material the LDFE projection
is driven negative and cannot accurately represent the solution.

\end{figure}

We now test the artificial source fixup and compare to two different cases.  The L$_2$
norm of the error in cell-averaged mean intensities $\|e\|_{a,rel}$ is computed using
Eq.~\eqref{eq:avg_err} from the last time step, averaged over 100
simulations.  Table.~\ref{tab:fixed_source_accuracy} compares the error and sample
statistics.  The absolute sample standard deviation of each value follows each value in parenthesis 
as appropriate.  Generally, artificial source fixup does not improve accuracy for this problem, and
rotating every batch appears to produce less error.  The artificial source can lead to
more negativities in down stream cells in some cases.  It is noted that for
this problem that although some negative intensities occur, the angular consistency terms
are not necessary.

\subsection{Radiative Transfer Problems}

We now test each of the fixups to the Marshak wave problem and two material problem from
Secs.~\ref{sec:marsh} and~\ref{sec:two}. For both problems, $\Delta t$ is
linearly increased from 0.001 sh to a maximum step size of $\Delta t_{\max} = 0.01$ sh,
the lumped representation is used for the LO solver in all cells, and the single HO solve
has three uniform batches of histories per time step.
For the two material problem, the simulation end time is 2 sh.  .  Table~\ref{tab:marsh_fixups} compares sample statistics for cell-averaged
solutions from the final time step for the Marshak wave problem and different numbers of
histories per time step.  The statistics were from 20 independent simulations, for different numbers
of histories per batch.  As demonstrated, there is no improvement with the artificial
source approach.  A plot of the radiation temperature for the final solution is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:marsh_fix} for each of the fixups.  As demonstrated, there is generally good
agreement, independent of the fixup used.  The artificial source slightly distributes the
wave-front.
