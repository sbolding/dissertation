-must be taken in how the error is added to the solution on a frace.  
-
-To demonstrate that the residual face source is unchanged, it is necessary to look at both 
-$\delta$-function face sources, which results from the discontinuity in the trial space.  For
-positive flow, at the node $x_{i+1/2}$, the face source is defined as
-\begin{equation}
-    \label{eq:res_face}
-    \rface = -\mu \pderiv{I^{(m)}}{x}\big|_{x_{i+1/2}} =-\mu\left( I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^+,\mu) -I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^-,\mu) \right)
-\end{equation}
-which is equivalent to the initial residual source. 
-
-The only difference from the original residual
-is that particles born from the $\delta^-$ source will contribute to the face tally at $x_{i+1/2}$.  
-Rather than sampling this source and contributing to these tallies, we can derive
-the analytic solution at that point resulting from the face source and add it to the MC
-solution without the contributions to the face from that tally.  Define the additional error
-from the face source as $\delta \epsilon^{(m)}$.  The transport equation satisfied by $\delta

-\begin{equation}
-    \label{eq:ho_face}
-    \mu \pderiv{\delta\epsilon^{(m)}}{x} + \hat\sigma_t \epsilon^{n+1} = 
-\end{equation}
-This equation is integrated from $x_{i+1/2}-\epsilon$ to $x_{i+1/2}$
-\begin{equation}
-    \dep(x_{i+1/2},\mu) - \dep(x_{i+1/2}-\epsilon,\mu)  + \int_{x_{i+1/2}-\epsilon}^0 
-      \hat \sigma_t \dep = 
-\end{equation}

+\section{Face Tallies and correction near $\mu=0$}
 \label{sec:face_tallies}
 
 Face-averaged estimators of the angular error are required to compute the outflow for
 estimating the spatial closure. The standard face-based
 tallies~\cite{shultis_mc,favorite_faces} are used.  Tallies are weighted by

 tally score, for the angular-averaged error $\epsilon_{a,i}$ is defined as
 \begin{equation}
-    \hat \epsilon_{a,i\pm1/2,j} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=1}^{N_{i+1/2,j}}
-    \frac{w_m(x_{i\pm1/2},\mu)}{h_{\mu} |\mu|}

+that crossed the surface $i\pm1/2$, in the $j$ angular element.   For the first
 moment, the tally is
-\begin{equation}
+\begin{equation}\label{eq:face_mutally}
     \hat \epsilon_{\mu,i\pm1/2,j} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=1}^{N_{i+1/2,j}} 
-    6\left(\frac{\mu-\mu_j}{h_\mu}\right) \frac{w_m(x_{i\pm1/2},\mu)}{|\mu| h_{\mu}}
+    6\left(\frac{\mu-\mu_j}{h_\mu}\right) \frac{w_m(x_{i\pm1/2},\mu)}{|\mu| h_{\mu}}.
 \end{equation}
 For positive and negative direction outflows are tallied
 on the $x_{i+1/2}$ and $x_{i-1/2}$ faces, respectively. Particles are only tallied after leaving
 a cell, and, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ldd_mc}, particles born on a surface do not contribute
 to the tally of that surface.
 
-Near $\mu=0$, particles can contribute large scores which can lead to large and
+Near $\mu=0$, particles can contribute large scores to the zeroth angular moment that lead to large and
 unbounded variances~\cite{favorite_faces}.  To avoid large variances, we have applied the standard fixup~\cite{mcnp,favorite_faces}.

+an isotropic particle density $I_0$, the average of
+$1/\mu$, for positive $\mu$, is
 \begin{equation}
-    \mom{1/\mu} = \frac{\int_0^{\mu_{cut}}\frac{1}{\mu} I \d \mu}{\int_0^{\mu_{cut}} I \d \mu} =
+    \overline{1/\mu} = \frac{\displaystyle \int_0^{\mu_{cut}}\frac{1}{\mu} I_0 \,\d

     \frac{2}{\mu_{cut}}.
 \end{equation}

+\section{MC solution with LDD trial space}
+\label{sec:ldd_mc}
+
+The inclusion of the outflow discontinuity has a minimal effect on the treatment of the
+residual source. The residual source and process of estimating moments of
+the error on the interior of a space-angle cell is unchanged.  The process of estimating
+the solution on the outgoing face requires tallying the solution when particles leave a
+cell. The tallying process is discussed later in Section~\ref{sec:face_tallies}.  
+
+Applying $L$ to the LDD trial space, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ldd}, results in two $\delta$ functions at each interior face.
+For positive flow, at a face $x_{i+1/2}$, the face portion of the residual is defined as
+\begin{align}
+    \label{eq:res_face}
+    \rface(x_{i+1/2}) &= -\mu \pderiv{\tilde I^{(m)}}{x}\big|_{x_{i+1/2}}\\
+    &= \rface(x_{i+1/2}^-)\delta^-(x - x_{i+1/2}) + \rface(x_{i+1/2}^+)\delta^+(x - x_{i+1/2}) 
+\end{align}
+where
+\begin{align}
+    \rface(x_{i+1/2}^-) &= -\mu\left( \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu) - \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^-,\mu)
+           \right)\\
+    \rface(x_{i+1/2}^+) &= -\mu\left( \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^+,\mu) -
+           \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu)
+           \right).
+\end{align}
+Here, $I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^+)$ and $I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^-)$ are the LD solution extrapolated to $x_{i+1/2}$ from the
+$x$ cell $i$ and cell $i+1$, respectively.
+Particles sampled from the two $\delta$-functions have the same starting location.  The
+only difference is, for positive $\mu$,  particles sampled from $\rface(x^-_{i+1/2})$ will
+contribute to the face tally at $x_{i+1/2}$; the opposite is true for negative $\mu$.
+
+To reduce variance, we do not sample the two $\delta$ functions independently.
+%or score contributions to the outflow face from the interior face source. 
+Instead, we combine the
+two $\delta$-functions into a single face source,
+do not score particles at the face they are sampled from, and add the analytic
+contribution from the interior face source to the error at the end of a batch.
+It is noted the combination of the two $\delta$-functions produces the same residual source as the
+original LD residual.
+
+Define the additional error contribution 
+from the face sources at $x_{i+1/2}$ as $\dep$.  This additional error is tallied
+everywhere by MC, except for at $x_{i+1/2}$.  The transport equation satisfied by $\dep$, for positive
+$\mu$, with effective total cross 
+section $\hat \sigma_t$, is
+\begin{equation}
+    \label{eq:ho_face}
+    \mu \pderiv{\dep}{x} + \hat\sigma_t \dep = \rface(x_{i+1/2}^-)\delta^-(x - x_{i+1/2}) + \rface(x_{i+1/2}^+)\delta^+(x - x_{i+1/2}) 
+\end{equation}
+This equation is integrated from $x_{i+1/2}-\alpha$ to $x_{i+1/2}$ to produce
+\begin{multline}
+    \mu\dep(x_{i+1/2},\mu) - \mu\dep(x_{i+1/2}-\alpha,\mu)  + \int\limits_{x_{i+1/2}-\alpha}^0 
+    \hat \sigma_t \dep \d x  \\ =  \rface(x_{i+1/2}^-) +
+        \int\limits_{x_{i+1/2}-\alpha}^0\rface(x_{i+1/2}^+)\delta^+(x - x_{i+1/2}) \d x.
+\end{multline}
+The integral on the right side of the equation is zero because $\delta^+(x-x_{i+1/2})$ is
+zero for $(-\infty,x_{i+1/2}]$.  The limit of the above equation is taken as $\alpha\to0$, i.e.,
+\begin{multline}
+    \lim_{\alpha\to0}\left( \mu\dep(x_{i+1/2},\mu) - \mu\dep(x_{i+1/2}-\alpha,\mu)  + \int\limits_{x_{i+1/2}-\alpha}^0 
+    \hat \sigma_t \dep \d x \right)  = \lim_{\alpha\to0} \rface(x_{i+1/2}^-) 
+\end{multline}
+The integral goes to zero because $\dep$ is smooth on the interior of the cell, and
+$\mu\dep(x_{i+1/2}-\alpha,\mu)$ goes to zero because there is no source upstream of
+$x_{i+1/2}^-$. Thus, the final solution is
+\begin{equation}
+    \dep(x_{i+1/2},\mu) = \frac{\rface(x_{i+1/2}^-)}{\mu} = 
+     \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^-,\mu) - \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu)
+.
+\end{equation}
+The update for $I(x_{i+1/2},\mu)$ is 
+\begin{align}
+   \tilde I^{(m+1)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu) &= \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu) + \epsilon^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu) +
+    \dep(x_{i+1/2},\mu) \\ 
+        &= \tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^-,\mu) + \epsilon^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu).
+\end{align}
+This result has the peculiar effect that the estimation of the solution on a face depends only on
+the interior solution $\tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2}^-,\mu)$ and not the previous face value 
+$\tilde I^{(m)}(x_{i+1/2},\mu)$. This could be used to only estimate
+face values in particular cells, at any particular batch.
